# Browser-Native Web Components


If you are a React, Angular, or Vue web developer, then you already know how powerful a component-based architecture is. What if you could get all of the benefits of components without the overhead of a 3rd-party framework? What if you could build components that transcend the ephemeral life cycle of 3rd-party frameworks and start building something whose duty cycle is measured in years, not months? 

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) demonstrates how W3C spec-compliant, browser-native web components fit into the modern web developer's toolkit. The web components umbrella is comprised of 4 related APIs that are all available -- polyfill-free -- in all major browsers today: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Template, and ES Modules. And since they are all deeply integrated down to the core of the browser, you can easily reuse them in the 3rd-party framework you're already familiar with.
